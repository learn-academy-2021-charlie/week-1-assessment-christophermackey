# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a block of code that takes in data, executes a task, and returns data. It is only executed once the function has been invoked. It is used so you don't have to re-write the same block of code when executing a task. You can simply declare the function as a constant and pass in data when the function is called on. 

  Researched answer: A function is a little machine that contains a set of instructions for performing a task. The logic is contained locally to the block of code with something called encapsulation. This allows that specific code to remain untouched from the rest of the program.



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: A parameter is basically a placeholder for the argument used in the function logic. An argument is the actual data that is passed to the function when it is called.

  Researched answer: A parameter is a placeholder variable listed in the function definition. Arguments are the literal values inputted to the function inside the parenthesis of the function invocation. The argument is represented in the function in place of the parameter, while still being encapsulated.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is zero-based and refers to the position of a value in an array. A value is form of data such as a string, number, boolean, etc. For example:
  var newArray = ["baby shark", 22, 8, "applesauce", true]
  The number 8 in the above array is a value with an index of 2.

  Researched answer: An index is the specific location of a value in an array. Indexes are zero-based and increase by 1 for each value. Values are data types contained in an array.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in method is used to manipulate data or refine it. It can perform tasks such as adding values to an array and alphabetizing an array.

  Researched answer: A built-in method is a small piece of functionality associated with an object, that allow us to perform common tasks such as accessing the content of an array or changing its content. Some built-in methods require additional info to be passed into the argument of the method. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Proper pair programming is a method of writing code with a partner while screen sharing. One person, the driver, has their screen shared and is typing code, while the second person, the navigator, is verbalizing instructions on how the code should flow. Both people should be communicating throughout each round, essentially psuedo-coding out loud. 

  Researched answer: Pair programming is technique with many benefits for each programmer and the code itsself. The cognitive load is distrubeted between a driver and a navigator, where the navigator focuses on the strategic direction of the code and the driver focuses on writing code. Having the work split likek this leads to fewer mistakes and a higher degree of problem-solving.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Working on challenges everyday right after learning the concepts is awesome. I feel like this reinforces the concepts while giving me practical coding time. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: the process of running code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. This allows us to perform a task, solve a problem, and present a solution when it is found.

2. Higher Order Functions: a function that is passed another function as an argument or returns a function. Must take at least one argument, but can have two or three

3. Jest: a JavaScript testing framework to ensure corectness of JavaScript code. It allows us to write tests that gives results quickly.

4. Classes: a template for creating objects. Similar to functions in that they encapsulate data, having their own scope.

5. React: a javascript library for building user interfaces for things like websites and apps. It is component based which allows it to be extremely scalable. It was created by Facebook!
